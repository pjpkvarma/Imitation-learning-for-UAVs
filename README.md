### 🚀 Project Overview
This project introduces an innovative framework leveraging imitation learning to develop UAVs capable of autonomously navigating complex urban environments. By mimicking expert demonstrations, UAVs can efficiently learn policies for last-mile delivery, urban air mobility, and emergency scenarios. The framework focuses on three core objectives:

- **Autonomous Route Planning**: Learning to optimize delivery paths for time and safety.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Using expert trajectories to navigate dynamic urban environments.
- **Adaptability**: Retraining to suit varying scenarios and environmental changes.

### 🛠️ Methodologies

#### Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
- Extracts reward functions from expert demonstrations to teach UAVs optimal behaviors.
- Balances route efficiency with safety metrics to create adaptable policies.

#### Policy Learning
- Utilizes deep neural networks to generalize learned behaviors to unseen environments.
- Ensures real-time decision-making capabilities with minimal latency.

#### Adaptable Framework
- Designed to retrain policies efficiently for new urban layouts and delivery scenarios.
- Incorporates simulation-to-reality transfer for robust real-world deployment.
